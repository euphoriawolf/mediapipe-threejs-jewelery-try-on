# Web Based Jewelery Try-on Demo

This project aims to create Real-time Web based Virtual Jewelery Try-on experiences.

It is built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), using [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe), [ThreeJS - react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [react-webcam](https://github.com/mozmorris/react-webcam).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Limitations

This project runs well on Desktop browsers (>20fps) but does not perform well on Mobile browsers (<5fps). This is due to MediaPipe.

## Work in Progress (WIP)

The 3D model currently currently tracks Ring Finger, but rotations and scaling are WIP.

### `npm start`
